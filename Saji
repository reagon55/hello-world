Dear Saji,

I hope you're doing well. I am writing to formally request an early release from my current role, as HR has indicated that this decision depends on your approval. Given my personal financial constraints, I would sincerely appreciate your support in allowing an early release prior to the proposed date of 30th October.

Having completed more than 10 years at Infosys, I am proud of the contributions I’ve made and the relationships I’ve built during this time. As per my recent discussion with [Manager’s Name], I have completed all my tasks, and there are no remaining dependencies on me within the project. Given this, I hope you will kindly consider my request for an earlier release.

Additionally, I am fully prepared to bear the cost of buying out my remaining notice period to ensure a smooth transition.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please feel free to reach out if any further discussion is needed.

Best regards,
Reagon Kumar
