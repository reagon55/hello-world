Hi Team,

To ensure we implement the guest WiFi creation feature according to our requirements, I have a few additional questions:

Default Credentials Storage:

Should we store the default credentials in a configuration file (e.g., YAML) or directly in the Java code? The configuration file offers easier updates and environment management, while hardcoding in Java is simpler initially but less flexible.
Credential Details and Format:

Could you please confirm the exact details and format for the default credentials (e.g., SSID, passphrase, security mode)?
Security Considerations:

Are there any specific security requirements or guidelines we need to follow when generating or storing the default credentials?
Identifier Requirements:

Do we need to follow any specific format or guidelines for generating the unique identifier for each guest WiFi setup?
Response Structure:

Is the current response structure sufficient, or do we need any additional fields or information to be included in the response?
Configuration Management:

If we store the credentials in a configuration file, are there any existing tools or practices we should follow for managing these configurations?
Environment-Specific Configurations:

Should the default credentials be different for various environments (e.g., development, staging, production), and if so, how should we manage these differences?
Testing and Validation:

Are there any specific test cases or validation criteria that need to be met for this functionality?
Logging and Monitoring:

Do we need to implement any logging or monitoring to track the creation and usage of guest WiFi networks?
Update Frequency:

How often do we anticipate needing to update the default credentials, and what is the preferred process for making these updates?
