When the prompt "create a guest WiFi with default credentials" is given, should the AI be responsible for setting up the guest WiFi network with the default credentials?
If so, should this setup involve interacting with the existing modem and C-App flow to configure the network and fetch the credentials?
Are there specific default credentials (SSID, passphrase, security mode) that we should use, or should the AI fetch these from the existing system as mentioned by you.
