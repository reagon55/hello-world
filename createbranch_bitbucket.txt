git checkout -b new-branch-name
Make Changes and Commit:

Make changes to your code, add files, and commit them to the new branch:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push the Branch to Bitbucket:

Push the new branch to Bitbucket:
bash
Copy code
git push origin new-branch-name
Using Bitbucket Web Interface:
Navigate to Your Repository:

Open your repository on the Bitbucket website.
Click on "Branches" in the Left Sidebar:

Find and click on the "Branches" option in the left sidebar.

Clone the Repository Locally:

If you haven't cloned the repository locally yet, you can do so using the "Clone" button on the Bitbucket repository page.
Now, you have created a new branch either using Git commands or the Bitbucket web interface. Make changes, commit, and push to this branch as needed.

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the exact location of the "Create Branch" option in Bitbucket may vary based on the version of Bitbucket or updates that have occurred since. However, I can provide you with general guidance on where to find it based on the typical Bitbucket interface.

Here are general steps to create a branch in Bitbucket:

Navigate to Your Repository:

Open your repository on the Bitbucket website.
Click on "Repository" or "Code" (May Vary):

Look for an option like "Repository" or "Code" in the navigation bar. Click on it.
Find "Branches" or "Source":

Look for an option like "Branches" or "Source" in the repository navigation menu. Click on it.
Locate the "Create Branch" Button:

In the "Branches" or "Source" view, there is typically a button labeled "Create Branch" or a similar option.
Enter Branch Details:

Click on the "Create Branch" button, and you should be prompted to enter details for your new branch, such as the branch name and an optional description.
Create the Branch:

After entering the branch details, there is usually a button to finalize or create the branch.
Please note that Bitbucket's interface may evolve, and the steps might vary based on updates or changes to the platform. If you're unable to locate the "Create Branch" option, I recommend checking the Bitbucket documentation or the user interface for any updated information specific to the version you're using.
