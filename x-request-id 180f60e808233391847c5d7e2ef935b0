Hi Team,

After thorough investigation with the provided x-request-id 180f60e808233391847c5d7e2ef935b0, here are the details and observations:

Build version: iOS_GB_12.45.0_1913_JIT_S3PROD_QA_01_08_2025
Device detail: iPhone 14 v17.2.1
Account: connecthub@virginmedia.com / Test1234
Findings:
Kibana Logs:

Searched and filtered the logs extensively in Kibana.
Observed several GET and POST requests, but no entries indicating calls to the voice-ai microservice.
The logs primarily indicate requests related to state checks and token validation.
Database Checks:

Verified in the database using the relevant customer ID.
No records or interactions indicating voice-ai calls or failures.
Conclusion:
There are no logs or database entries suggesting that the voice-ai microservice was called or encountered any failures for the given x-request-id. This suggests that either the request to the voice-ai microservice never occurred or there was an issue before reaching that stage.
