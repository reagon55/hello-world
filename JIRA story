To create the JIRA stories for your two microservices (Voice-as and aws-ai-connector) and the corresponding automation testing, you can break down the tasks into four distinct stories. Below are the suggested stories along with their descriptions:

Story 1: Component Testing for Voice-as Microservice
Title: Component Testing for Voice-as Microservice

Description:
As a developer, I want to create component tests for the Voice-as microservice to ensure that each individual component works as expected in isolation.

Acceptance Criteria:

Create test cases for voice input handling.
Create test cases for converting voice input to text.
Mock dependencies like external APIs and services.
Validate the outputs against expected results.
Ensure tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
Story 2: Component Testing for aws-ai-connector Microservice
Title: Component Testing for aws-ai-connector Microservice

Description:
As a developer, I want to create component tests for the aws-ai-connector microservice to ensure that each individual component works as expected in isolation.

Acceptance Criteria:

Create test cases for handling AWS API interactions.
Mock AWS Transcribe and other AWS services.
Validate the response handling and processing logic.
Ensure the tests cover all critical paths and edge cases.
Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
Story 3: Automation Testing for Voice-as Microservice
Title: Automation Testing for Voice-as Microservice

Description:
As a QA engineer, I want to automate the testing for the Voice-as microservice using the msa-test-automation microservice to ensure the service behaves as expected under various scenarios.

Acceptance Criteria:

Identify key scenarios for automation testing.
Develop automation test scripts using msa-test-automation.
Ensure tests cover functional and non-functional requirements.
Validate the automated test results.
Schedule automated tests to run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Story 4: Automation Testing for aws-ai-connector Microservice
Title: Automation Testing for aws-ai-connector Microservice

Description:
As a QA engineer, I want to automate the testing for the aws-ai-connector microservice using the msa-test-automation microservice to ensure the service behaves as expected under various scenarios.

Acceptance Criteria:

Identify key scenarios for automation testing.
Develop automation test scripts using msa-test-automation.
Ensure tests cover all API interactions and edge cases.
Validate the automated test results.
Schedule automated tests to run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Steps to Create Stories in JIRA
Log in to JIRA:

Navigate to your JIRA project.
Create a New Story:

Click on the “Create” button.
Select “Story” as the issue type.
Fill in the Details:

Enter the title and description as outlined above.
Set the appropriate priority and assignee.
Add Acceptance Criteria:

Include the acceptance criteria for each story to define what needs to be done.
Save the Story:

Click the “Create” button to save the story.
Repeat the process for each of the four stories. This will help you organize your tasks and ensure that each microservice and its corresponding tests are properly covered.
