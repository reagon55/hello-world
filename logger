Ensure you have correctly set up the WireMock server and created the necessary stubs for the endpoints you are mocking.
Verify the configuration for capturing log data, particularly the logger name. Typically, WireMock logs can be customized or redirected by configuring the logging framework (like Logback or Log4j) used in your project.
If you need to extract the logger name, you might need to delve into your logging configuration files (e.g., logback.xml or log4j2.xml) to understand how loggers are set up.
