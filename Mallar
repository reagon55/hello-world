Dear Mallar,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your assistance regarding my request for an early exit, which has not yet been approved by my managers, Ranjit and Sridevi.

I had initially sent a formal request for early exit to both of my managers, detailing my reasons and timeline. Despite following up, I have not received their approval or any feedback on the matter. This delay is affecting my planned exit timeline and causing uncertainty.

I kindly request your intervention to expedite the process or guide me on the next steps I should take to ensure a smooth transition. I appreciate your support in helping me resolve this situation at the earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Warm regards,
