Do we need to focus on creating Kafka producer or component testing here

Based on the Jira story and the details provided in the images, the primary focus appears to be on creating a Kafka producer within the ACS connector for the spv-registered-wifi use case. The description outlines the specific flow for the Kafka producer and how it should interact with the system when handling stabilization times and active modems.

However, in addition to the creation of the Kafka producer, component testing would also be essential to ensure that the Kafka producer functions correctly within the ACS connector. This testing should validate the interactions between the Kafka producer and other components in the system, such as ensuring that messages are correctly produced and consumed as expected.

In summary:

The primary focus is on creating the Kafka producer.
Component testing should be conducted after the producer is created to ensure that it integrates and functions as required within the overall system.
You should allocate time and resources to both tasks, with the Kafka producer development as the initial priority followed by comprehensive component testing.

To create a Kafka producer within the ACS connector for the spv-registered-wifi use case, you'll need to implement a Kafka producer and then integrate it into the ACS connector. Below is an example implementation using the Kafka client library in Java.

Step 1: Add Kafka Dependencies
First, ensure that you have the necessary Kafka dependencies in your pom.xml if you're using Maven:

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
Step 2: Create the Kafka Producer Configuration
You need to configure your Kafka producer settings. Here's an example configuration:

java
Copy code
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaProducerConfig {

    public static KafkaProducer<String, String> createProducer() {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");  // Replace with your Kafka server address
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, "all");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, 3);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.LINGER_MS_CONFIG, 1);

        return new KafkaProducer<>(props);
    }
}
Step 3: Create the Kafka Producer
Next, implement the Kafka producer to send messages. This code will send a message to the Kafka topic when an event occurs in your system.

java
Copy code
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.RecordMetadata;

import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class ACSKafkaProducer {

    private final KafkaProducer<String, String> producer;
    private final String topic;

    public ACSKafkaProducer(String topic) {
        this.producer = KafkaProducerConfig.createProducer();
        this.topic = topic;
    }

    public void sendEvent(String key, String value) {
        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, key, value);
        try {
            Future<RecordMetadata> future = producer.send(record);
            RecordMetadata metadata = future.get();  // Synchronous send, you can make it asynchronous if needed
            System.out.println("Message sent to topic: " + metadata.topic() + " with offset: " + metadata.offset());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            // Handle failure case here
        }
    }

    public void closeProducer() {
        producer.close();
    }
}
Step 4: Integrate Kafka Producer in ACS Connector
Now, you need to integrate this Kafka producer into the ACS connector workflow where the events trigger.

java
Copy code
public class ACSConnectorService {

    private final ACSKafkaProducer kafkaProducer;

    public ACSConnectorService() {
        // Replace "spv_registered_wifi" with your actual Kafka topic name
        this.kafkaProducer = new ACSKafkaProducer("spv_registered_wifi");
    }

    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        // Your logic to process the event
        String key = event.getCustomerId();
        String value = createEventPayload(event);

        // Send the event to Kafka
        kafkaProducer.sendEvent(key, value);
    }

    private String createEventPayload(Event event) {
        // Serialize your event into a string (e.g., JSON format)
        return "Serialized event data here";  // Replace this with actual serialization logic
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        kafkaProducer.closeProducer();
    }
}
Step 5: Handle the Event Trigger
Integrate the ACSConnectorService within the ACS Connector where the spv-registered-wifi events occur, likely within your existing method that processes stabilization times or POST requests.

java
Copy code
public class ACSConnectorController {

    private final ACSConnectorService acsConnectorService = new ACSConnectorService();

    public void onSpvRegisteredWifiEvent(Event event) {
        // Process the event and send it to Kafka
        acsConnectorService.processEvent(event);
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        acsConnectorService.shutdown();
    }
}
Step 6: Ensure Component Testing
Ensure that you have unit tests for the Kafka producer. You can use a library like mockito-kafka or embedded-kafka for testing Kafka integration.

Example Test
java
Copy code
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

class ACSKafkaProducerTest {

    private KafkaProducer<String, String> mockProducer;
    private ACSKafkaProducer kafkaProducer;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        mockProducer = Mockito.mock(KafkaProducer.class);
        kafkaProducer = new ACSKafkaProducer("test_topic");
    }

    @Test
    void testSendEvent() {
        kafkaProducer.sendEvent("testKey", "testValue");

        Mockito.verify(mockProducer).send(Mockito.any(ProducerRecord.class));
    }
}
Summary
This code sets up a Kafka producer in the ACS connector, allowing you to send messages to a Kafka topic for spv-registered-wifi events. You'll need to adapt the serialization logic and Kafka topic names to fit your exact requirements.

Make sure to integrate this producer into your existing ACS connector and conduct appropriate testing to ensure that it functions as expected.
